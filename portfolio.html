		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>
			I graduated in 2014 from UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor's Degree in American History and Education. Since I was a child I wanted to be a teacher. However, starting a youth empowerment nonprofit at my university with 11 other student leaders revealed my passion for nonprofit development and community empowerment through youth programs.
			<br>
			<br>
			After graduation, I shifted my career focus from education to nonprofit work. I am now working as the Program and Development Assistant at Girls on the Run of the Bay Area, a girl-empowerment organization serving thousands of girls across 5 Bay Area Counties.
			<br>
			<br>
			I am also certified as a Compost and Garden Educator by the San Francisco Department of the Environment. I volunteer at Garden for the Environment on 7th and Lawton in San Francisco. I am currently building a community-based business named Community Compost Project, a network connecting local food gardens to home composters.
			<br>
			<br>
			Currently enrolled in a full-stack web development boot camp at the UC Berkeley Extension learning front-end fundamentals, server-side architectures, database management systems, advanced front-end frameworks, data structures and algorithms.
